# Security

## Health Monitor

- ## Scan Compliance

  A compliance scan is like a check-up for software code. It looks at the code to see if it follows all the rules and standards are met.

  Our platform will check compliance for all your applications under one roof and you can view it in a Gauge format. You donâ€™t need any separate configurations to create this visualization. .

  Furthermore, you can organize these scans according to your workspace and environment of the applications.

  **Tip**ðŸ’¡
  **_A compliance scan is super useful. It gives a clear picture of how well the code meets the standards. This helps developers know what needs fixing or improving_**.

- ## CVE Chart

  A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) scan looks for weaknesses or holes that hackers could exploit to cause problems. These weaknesses are called vulnerabilities. The scan rates these vulnerabilities based on how serious they are, which helps the developers understand which ones need fixing urgently.

  Once you add your codebase and deploy your code, automatic scanning will start with each version change. You donâ€™t need any separate configurations to create this visualization.

- ## Report

  Security report gives you the overall view of underlying problems that could harm your application.

  You can download SBOM/CVEs from the platform and fix it. Donâ€™t worry about deploying again, because as soon as you commit changes, it will trigger automatically.
