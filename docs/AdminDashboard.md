# Admin Dashboard

## All About Admin Settings

   The admin dashboard allows the admin to invite new users to the organization and manage existing users.

- ### Accessing the Dashboard

   You can access the Admin Dashboard by selecting the "Settings" option in the left sidebar of the Initializ.ai console. Only the admin can access the Admin Dashboard. The user who initially creates the organization will be designated as the initial admin.

   An admin can invite new users for the roles of admin, workspace-admin, or developer, and all invited admins will have the same privileges as the initial admin.

    There are two possible scenarios
    #### 1. The user is already registered with Initializ.ai
    In this instance, you need to enter the user's email address, select their role, and choose the specific workspace to which you wish to invite them. The username will be automatically retrieved from the user's account.
