# Workspaces

## Collaborate and Create

- ## Organizations

  Workspaces are a unique feature provided by initializ.ai so users can collaborate with their team in a particular organization. A user can create multiple workspaces and add members within an organization.

  Users can add their respective organizations while registering for the platform.
