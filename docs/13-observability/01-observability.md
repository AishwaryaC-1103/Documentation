### Forwarding
<!-- <span className="smallFont"> -->
Forwarding involves collecting data and logs from all applications in the workspace and sending them to platforms like Splunk, Loggly, Datadog, New Relic for centralized management. This process enables real-time analytics, advanced search options, and customizable visualizations, enhancing monitoring and scalability. Additionally, it helps organizations derive actionable insights and maintain security.
